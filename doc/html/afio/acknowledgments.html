<p>
      We would like to thank all the people who contributed to the development of
      this library, many of whom are not listed here but nevertheless are due our
      thanks. Our especial thanks goes (in chronological order since 2012):
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
          To my former team at BlackBerry (of whom Tony van Eerd is best known to
          the C++ community) for the off the cuff discussions which led to me to
          conceptualise AFIO as an out-of-work side project.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Google, for sponsoring Paul to work on AFIO as part of Google Summer
          of Code 2013. Paul did the lion's share of the work of porting the preexisting
          pure C++ 11 code base to Boost and to older compilers, both tasks which
          could never be called fun by anyone.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To the family and friends who had to put up with us during Google Summer
          of Code 2013 adding 15-25 hours per week above and beyond our normal work
          hours which meant time not spent with them. This part is without doubt
          the hardest part of developing a new Boost library &#8212; what it requires
          you to sacrifice in exchange for what little free time is already left
          over after a work week.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To my former team and division at BlackBerry who successfully obtained
          the first ever corporate permission for an employee to contribute to a
          non-business open source project. The many months of wrangling to achieve
          that win was made moot when I was downsized towards the end of GSoC just
          weeks after gaining the landmark approval from Legal, nevertheless my thanks
          are due to BlackBerry for trying to change itself and letting me be a part
          of that.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Christopher M. Kohlhoff for providing Boost.ASIO, which has been a high
          benchmark to aspire towards.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Beman Dawes for providing Boost.Filesystem and the Filesystem TS, without
          which filesystem paths would be far more tricky to handle well in C++.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Artur Laksberg for reviewing AFIO early on and making a number of valuable
          observations.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Bjorn Reese for taking the time to be an early adopter of AFIO, and
          making many observations of where AFIO could be obviously improved, almost
          all of which were our delight to enact.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Vicente J. Botet Escriba for very kindly adding a method to Boost.Thread's
          future's for directly fetching their exception_ptr. This greatly improved
          AFIO's exception propagation performance.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Megan and Clara for putting up with the nightly 12am to 4am weekday
          after-work slots during 2015 which were necessary to make any progress
          on AFIO and its sublibraries APIBind, Spinlock and Monad.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To the many people on the boost-dev mailing list who contributed feedback
          on the design of the sublibraries APIBind, Spinlock and Monad.
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          To Ahmed Charles for volunteering to review manage AFIO after two years
          of waiting in the Boost peer review queue - thank you Ahmed!
        </li>
<li class="listitem">
          And finally to all those who have submitted bugs and pull requests for
          AFIO, too many to list here.
        </li>
