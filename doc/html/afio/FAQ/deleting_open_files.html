<p>
        On POSIX you are allowed to call <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">unlink</span><span class="special">()</span></code> on a file which is open for use &#8212;
        indeed this is a very convenient way of creating an anonymous private temporary
        file whose storage will be deallocated on the last file handle close. Ordinarily
        Windows does not permit deletion or renaming of files still in use, but if
        all open handles to that file were opened with <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">FILE_SHARE_DELETE</span></code>
        then it <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> permit renames and deletions of open files.
      </p>
<p>
        There are however some gotchas with this, and it is worth listing them here.
        Firstly, Windows never allows you to really delete an open file, rather it
        is flagged as delete pending and its entry in its directory remains visible
        (though no new file handles may be opened to it) and when the very last open
        handle to the file in the system is closed, only then is it truly deleted.
        Well, actually only <span class="emphasis"><em>sort of truly deleted</em></span>, because Windows
        only <span class="emphasis"><em>appears</em></span> to remove the file entry from the directory,
        but in fact that entry is merely hidden and actually still exists and attempting
        to create a file with the same name will return an access denied error. How
        long it silently exists for depends on a range of factors, but put it this
        way: if your code loops creating and deleting the same file name as you might
        when operating a lock file, you're going to see lots of random spurious access
        denied errors and truly dismal lock file performance compared to POSIX.
      </p>
<p>
        Note that this lazy file deletion is different from <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">file tunnelling</span>&#8221;</span>
        whereby a file created with the same name as a recently deleted file silently
        inherits its creation time and other metadata. I mention this because this
        feature also gets in the way of POSIX file semantics, but for other reasons.
      </p>
<p>
        AFIO works around these un-POSIX file semantics by taking a dual step to
        deleting files. Firstly, it renames the file to a 128 bit cryptographically
        strong random name prefixed by <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">.afiod</span>&#8221;</span> into as high up the
        directory hierarchy as it is able to, and only then does it request the deletion
        of the file. As AFIO always opens files with <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">FILE_SHARE_DELETE</span></code>
        permission enabled, with that flag Windows permits renaming and deletion,
        and because the name was changed to a very random name somewhere not in its
        origin directory before deletion, you don't see those unexpected and random
        errors when creating files with the same name as a recently deleted file
        as you do anywhere else on Windows. Because the file is probably not in its
        original containing directory any more, deletions of that directory will
        not fail with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">directory not empty</span>&#8221;</span> as they otherwise normally
        would and indeed do in most Windows programs. Handy eh?
      </p>
<p>
        Unfortunately, there are additional problems with deleting directories caused
        by AFIO's caching of directory handles in a central table &#8212; this happens
        by default for all directories opened without write permissions and without
        the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">file_flags</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">unique_directory_handle</span></code> flag. Explicit
        close handle requests for these cached directories are ignored by AFIO, and
        therefore AFIO may hold into existence a directory longer than might otherwise
        be anticipated with the only way of forcing actual deletion being the destruction
        of any reference to that directory, something difficult to achieve in larger
        more complex codebases. Nevertheless, as it is the system which does the
        deletion, you are guaranteed by Windows that the directory will eventually
        be cleaned up some day, possibly in weeks or months on a long lived system.
        If you don't want this, open directories with write permissions or the unique
        directory handle flag.
