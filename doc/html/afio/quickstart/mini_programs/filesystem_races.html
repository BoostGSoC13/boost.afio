          Filing systems are a shared resource common to all processes on the system
          and sometimes the network, and are therefore as a globally shared resource
          inherently racy. Yet overwhelmingly programs, even often those written
          by world expert programmers, singularly assume the filing system to be
          a static, constant and unchanging place only modifiable by the current
          program, as indeed did until very recently the POSIX API standard which
          defines the common API for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and other Unices. When
          bug reports come in of data being lost, even very large professional corporations
          can make a real hash of testing that their <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">fix</span>&#8221;</span> isn't worse
          at losing data than the previous more naive implementation. This is because
          when you program against a mental model of a static, unchanging filesystem
          you will become inevitably surprised when it happens to change at exactly
          the wrong moment &#8212; which of course is a moment you can never replicate
          on your developer workstation, thus making finding and fixing these sorts
          of bug highly non-trivial.
        </p>
<p>
          In case you don't realise how much user data and productivity is lost each
          year to filing system races, just look up <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">corrupted Office file</span>&#8221;</span>
          on Google and weep. Even for us programmers, if you try keeping a Git repository
          on a Samba drive expect some interesting, and moreover quite strongly associated
          to specific combinations of client accessing the repo concurrently, object
          database corruption from time to time.
        </p>
<p>
          Well, there is some good news: AFIO makes maximum use of host OS filing
          system race safeguards, so if you write your code against AFIO and take
          note of the race guarantees section in each individual per-API reference
          documentation page, you should hopefully avoid any possibility of experiencing
          filing system races.

          AFIO provides for managing filing system raciness</a>
        </h6>
<p>
          Firstly, readers will probably be quite surprised to learn that the only
          operating system capable of providing completely race free filing system
          behaviour is Microsoft Windows, or rather the very well designed NT kernel
          API which AFIO uses directly. Linux provides robust file descriptor path
          discovery and the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">XXXat</span><span class="special">()</span></code> POSIX APIs, and with those AFIO can provide
          pretty good race condition safety on Linux up to the final directory in
          the path. Mac OS X provides an unfortunately quite broken file descriptor
          path discovery, and additionally does not provide the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">XXXat</span><span class="special">()</span></code> POSIX APIs and so AFIO cannot provide
          race protection, but can throw exceptions sometimes if it detects the filesystem
          has suddenly changed and you're about to delete the wrong file (you shouldn't
          rely on this, it's racy). FreeBSD provides the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">XXXat</span><span class="special">()</span></code> POSIX APIs, but its file descriptor path
          discovery only works correctly for directory not file handles due to a
          kernel bug (I've opened a feature request ticket for this at <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=198570" target="_top">https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=198570</a>)
          and therefore AFIO can provide only race condition safety for directories
          only on FreeBSD.
        </p>
<p>
          Additionally, working with the filing system in a race safe way on POSIX
          requires opening a file descriptor to the containing directory for every
          operation (some proprietary Linux extensions allow this to be avoided for
          some operations on newer Linux kernels). AFIO will keep a global cache
          of open file handles for containing directories on request using the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">file_flags</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">hold_parent_open</span></code> flag which can be enabled
          per dispatcher or per individual file handle open, this very significantly
          reduces the cost of race condition safety on POSIX <span class="emphasis"><em>for file entries
          only</em></span> as directories ignore the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">file_flags</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">hold_parent_open</span></code>
          flag, though at the cost of increased file descriptor usage, which has
          low hard limits especially on OS X which is why it is disabled by default.
          The alternative if you don't want AFIO to bother with race safety is to
          specify the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">file_flags</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">no_race_protection</span></code>
          flag per dispatcher or per individual file handle open, this causes AFIO
          to use the same maximum performance code paths as used before the v1.3
          engine.

          to implement filing system race safety on AFIO</a>
        </h6>
<p>
          The essential rule for achieving maximum filing system race safety is to
          avoid using absolute paths where possible. If you want your code to also
          be safe on POSIX, you must additionally only assume race safety up to the
          final directory in a path &#8212; thereafter design your node to never
          behave racily within a single directory.
        </p>
<p>
          The core container type for specifying a location on the filing system
          to AFIO is <a class="link" href="../../reference/structs/path_req.html" title="path_req"><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">path_req</span></code></a> which looks like this:
        </p>
<pre class="programlisting"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="identifier">path_req</span>
<span class="special">{</span>
    <span class="keyword">bool</span> <span class="identifier">is_relative</span><span class="special">;</span>              <span class="comment">// Whether the precondition is also where this path begins.</span>
    <span class="identifier">afio</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">path</span> <span class="identifier">path</span><span class="special">;</span>               <span class="comment">// The filing system path to be used for this operation.</span>
    <span class="identifier">file_flags</span> <span class="identifier">flags</span><span class="special">;</span>              <span class="comment">// The flags to be used for this operation (note they can be overriden by flags passed during dispatcher construction).</span>
    <span class="identifier">future</span><span class="special">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="identifier">precondition</span><span class="special">;</span>         <span class="comment">// An optional precondition for this operation.</span>
    <span class="identifier">path_req</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="identifier">T</span> <span class="special">&amp;&amp;);</span>                <span class="comment">// Converts T to a filesystem::path, makes it absolute, then converts to an afio::path</span>
    <span class="identifier">path_req</span><span class="special">(</span><span class="keyword">bool</span><span class="special">,</span> <span class="identifier">T</span> <span class="special">&amp;&amp;);</span>          <span class="comment">// If the bool is true, converts T to an afio::path fragment. If false, same as above overload (i.e. make absolute).</span>
<span class="special">};</span>
</pre>
<p>
          For convenience, type markup is provided for the boolean taking constructor,
          these being <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">path_req</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">relative</span></code> and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">path_req</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">absolute</span></code>.
        </p>
<p>
          If the path is relative, then the path of the precondition is used as the
          base from which the relative path fragment operates. On FreeBSD, Linux
          and Windows this base extension happens inside the kernel and so the current
          path of the precondition really doesn't matter &#8212; it could be changing
          a thousand times per second and it wouldn't matter. On OS X due to lack
          of the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">XXXat</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          POSIX APIs the path of the precondition is fetched and the extension done
          by hand.
        </p>
<p>
          An AFIO extension allows you to specify a file as precondition. In this
          situation, if you specify an empty path then you mean the precondition
          itself which is very useful for deleting or renaming an open file handle.
          If you want a sibling file, this can be found via a path fragment starting
          with <code class="computeroutput"><span class="special">../</span></code>, though note that
          this necessarily is racy to the containing directory (AFIO opens the containing
          directory of the file, ensuring the directory contains an inode matching
          the file, and then uses that directory handle as a base &#8212; the race
          here being if the file relocates after matching its containing directory).
        </p>

          specific to Microsoft Windows</a>
        </h6>
<p>
          Finally, there are some gotchas specific to Microsoft Windows:
        </p>
<p>
          1. You cannot rename a directory which has an open file handle in any process
          to any item anywhere within itself or its children.
        </p>
<p>
          2. You cannot rename to a destination which has an open file handle with
          DELETE permissions (<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">file_flags</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">write</span></code>)
          to itself or any of its parent directories in any process. You CAN do this
          from a source like this, but the destination cannot be like this (why is
          this? It is not documented anywhere in Microsoft's documentation, but if
          I had to guess, I'd suggest that the atomicity of the rename is implemented
          by taking an op lock on the destination, an op lock not granted if any
          handles exist which could change the path suddenly. I'm not sure if Microsoft
          are themselves aware of this limitation).
        </p>
<p>
          One might note that much of the utility of race protecting APIs is lost
          with these restrictions. However, note that one could emulate POSIX semantics
          by renaming out all the contents of a directory to be renamed to elsewhere,
          rename the directory, and then renaming the contents back in. Given the
          pathetic slowness of opening handles on Windows, this might seem impossibly
          inefficient, however NT provides a little known <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">FILE_DELETE_CHILD</span></code>
          permission which gives you delete/rename permission on all the children
          and subchildren of a directory with just one handle open. I learned about
          this flag the hard way, by it breaking in many subtle ways AFIO's functioning
          on Windows when it was requested by default, something which took several
          days of head scratching to track down. AFIO doesn't currently do this trick
          of renaming out and back in on Windows, but might in the future after a
          lot more experimentation as to if it is viable and reliable without surprises.
        </p>
<p>
          On Windows opening a directory with write access requests rename/delete
          privileges, whereas on POSIX the write access request is ignored for directories
          as POSIX doesn't allow it anyway. This allows you to write identical code
          which works universally.
        </p>
<p>
          As an example of some programming AFIO safely on an extremely unstable
          filing system, below is the functional test which verifies AFIO for filing
          system race safety. As you will see, a worker thread is solely dedicated
          to renaming directories to unique names whilst the main thread creates
          files inside those constantly changing directories, and relinks them into
          another directory which is also constantly changing on POSIX, but is stable
          on Windows. This is iterated for a substantial period of time to verify
          that nothing goes wrong.
